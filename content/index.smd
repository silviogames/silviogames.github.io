Hey, my name is Silvio.

I'm a geology master student and a hobbyist gamedev. After many years working with Java and Libgdx I finally moved on and learned zig and raylib.

Currently (2025) I work on a 2D mining and survival game called "Geo Survivor" and I'm currently working on getting a Demo ready, to put on steam.
